            <h1>Last Words</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Maharana Pratap died of injuries sustained in a hunting accident. He died at Chavand, which served as his capital, on <b>29 January 1597</b>, aged fifty-seven.</li>
                <li>Maharana Paratap was lying on the bed made of grass even when he was dying as his oath of freeing Chittod was not still fulfilled. At the last moment, he took his son Amar Singh's hand and handed over the responsibility of freeing Chittod to his son and died in peace.</li>
                <li>There is no comparison to his fight with a cruel emperor like Akbar. When almost the whole of Rajasthan was under the control of the Mughal Emperor Akbar, Maharana Pratap fought for <b>12  years</b> to save Mewar. Akbar tried various means to defeat Maharana but he remainded unbeatable till the end. Besides, he also freed a large portion of land in Rajsthan from Mughals.</li>
                <li>He underwent so much of hardship but he preserved the name of his family and his Motherland from defeat. His life was so bright that the other name for freedom could have been 'Maharana Pratap'.</li>
